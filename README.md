## Lesson 10 - 18th December 2023
### Agenda
* Advanced types in TypeScript (Tomas Petricek – guest lecture)

### Preparation
* If you do not have Node.js installed, get the LTS version from https://nodejs.org (but any reasonably recent version should work)
* We will use Vite.js framework, which is installed via npm (Node package manager). To test if things work for you, run `npm create vite@latest` as explained in https://vitejs.dev/guide/
* Enter project name, select Vanilla, TypeScript and follow printed instructions to run the project.
* You will need an editor that does checking in background. Visual Studio Code is a good choice, but anything will do.
